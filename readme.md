Amazon has Dash buttons, but no gifflar.

I love gifflar!

Luckily we have Oda, but they had no documented api, so I analyzed how Oda submitted orders and wrote a quick Oda buy gifflar script!

(I love gifflar!!)

## How to use
create a `.env` file and add `username=*value*` and `password=*value*` replace `*value*` with your actual credentials

You also have to find your `PAYMENT_METHOD` and `DELIVERY_ID`, and add that.

Then by running the script it will buy a pack of gifflar and submit a order for the next available delivery slot :)
